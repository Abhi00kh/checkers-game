# Checkers Game

A simple implementation of the classic Checkers game using Python and Pygame. This project allows two players to play a standard game of Checkers on an 8x8 board, with features like piece movement, king promotion, and turn-based gameplay.

## Features

- **Two-Player Gameplay:** Supports two players, with alternating turns.
- **Piece Movement:** Move pieces diagonally and jump over opponent pieces to capture them.
- **King Promotion:** Pieces reaching the opposite side of the board are promoted to kings, which can move and capture in both directions.
- **Victory Conditions:** The game checks for win conditions, including capturing all opponent pieces or blocking their valid moves.
